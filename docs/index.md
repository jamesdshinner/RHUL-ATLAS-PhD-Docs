# Welcome to the RHUL ATLAS PhD Software Tutorials

This site is home to a collection of tutorials covering the various software tools that are utilised by PhD students working in the ATLAS group at Royal Holloway, University of London. It is intended to ease the process of learning to use these tools and to pass on the knowledge of existing PhD students, in order to prevent new students having to reinvent the wheel.

The collection comprises tutorials for physics-specific software tools such as AnalysisTop, TRexFitter, and MadGraph, along with tutorials for multi-purpose software tools such as Keras/TensorFlow, Docker, and HTCondor.

The source material for the site is stored in [a Github repo](https://github.com/rhulpp/RHUL-ATLAS-PhD-Docs), which also contains information on how to update material or contribute additional tutorials.

The tutorials can be navigated via the sidebar on the left, or you can get started with the first tutorial by clicking the button below.
